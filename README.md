## 42 Calendar Listener

***Tired of constantly refreshing the booking screen to find a time slot? Time to automate this! Try the 42 Calendar Listener and make scheduling as easy as pie.***

### Important Notes:

- **Security Warning**: Running scripts directly from `curl` can be dangerous, especially if the script has not been reviewed by the user. It's a good practice to encourage users to first review the script before executing it, especially if it's being piped directly into `bash`.
- **Permissions**: The user running the script will need appropriate permissions to install software and write to the system directories involved.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that users know they need `curl`, `git`, and `python3` installed on their system before running the script.
